# Embedeed_C_Pong_Game
This programm is an implementation of one-person pong-game. I've made this game on NUCLEO-L476RG board so if you want to use different stm32 microcontroler you should change PIN's settings. Also, I've used ST7735S Controller to display the game and B103 267 JoyStick for platform control.
